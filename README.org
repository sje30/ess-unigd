* Introduction

Emacs can show images, such as PNG, SVG, PDF, in buffers.  For a long
time, I've wondered how to get output from R into an Emacs buffer.
This is non-trivial as far as I know because you typically need to
wrap your R code in calls to start an R device and then wait until the
device is closed before the plot is created.

I recently saw this excellent video from Bruno Rodrigues introducing
the httpgd package: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxyhmhRVOfw>. The
[[https://github.com/nx10/httpgd][httpgd package]]  from Florian Rupprecht provides a web interface to his
unified graphic device [[https://github.com/nx10/unigd][unigd]].  This allows you to view plots and
tables in a web browser.

Although Emacs can view web content, e.g. with eww, the lack of
javascript in Emacs means that the httpgd package doesn't work
directly.  However, it can still be used to serve up SVG images of the
plots which Emacs can then render.  See the following movie for a
proof of concept.

* Requirements

- Newish Emacs (tested on Emacs 29).
- ESS
- curl, perl, md5sum
- httpgd R package

* Installation and usage

1. Clone this repo
2. =chmod +x check_outputs.pl=
2. Open unigd.el and run =M-x eval-buffer=
3. =M-x R= within this directory (so it will find =check_outputs.pl=).
4. =M-x ess-unigd-start= should then open up the placeholder file
   =latest.svg=.
5. Return to the *R* buffer and start plotting...  In a background
   buffer =*unigd-watcher*= you should see the output from the perl
   script as it polls httpgd.

* Next steps


** Websockets

Current approach is to use a perl script to check every 1 second to
see if a new plot has been made.  Would be more efficient to use the
websocket technology to receive updates from httpgd directly.

Emacs has <https://blog.abrochard.com/websockets.html> but I can't see
how this works currently.

** Alternative output formats

Would a PNG rather than SVG be any more performant (to reduce flicker)?


** Adjust to size of buffer.  Dynamically update?

The default image size sent by httpgd is 720x576.  This could instead
be determined by the current size of the Emacs buffer (and updated if
the buffer changes size) using

    (window-pixel-height)
    (window-pixel-width)

** Browse history of plots

The httpgd server remembers the plots created so we should be able to
dynamically go through the history of plots.
