* Version 2 of code

See =example.R= for documentation, and [[https://youtu.be/TrwE_80eVTw][example video]].

This version uses [[https://blog.abrochard.com/websockets.html][websockets]] to communicate directly between Emacs and
the httpgd() device.  This is efficient, as httpgd() notifies Emacs
when a new plot is made, rather than needing to poll every 2 seconds.

(This version requires the R session is running locally.  If you are
using ESS and Tramp to run a remote R session, this is highly unlikely
to work.  For remote usage, something similar to version 1 of the code
is probably going to be required.)

** Things to do:

- [ ] Close the *essgd* window when the *R* session closes, or if the
  httgpd() device is closed.
- [ ] Investigate window layouts so that manual placement of windows
  not required.
- [ ] Provide an interface from essgd for deleting plots (or clearing
  them all).
- [ ] Provide easy ways of downloading current plot as e.g. pdf or
  svg.
